# Buy me a coffee Dapp
[coffeeDApp](https://omoesther.github.io/Buy-me-a-coffee-/)

A Mini Buymeacoffee DApp Using ReactJs, and tailwind CSS. It'll be a platform where anyone on the internet can learn a little about us and send us money to purchase coffee + a note, with the information being kept on the NEAR Protocol blockchain via an smart contract.

I repurposed this DApp from my celo submission. I made a bit more changes to the UI to give it a bit of a spark, I trust you'll like it.


# Idea Behing Submission.
Buy Me A Coffee is a popular website that creators, educators, entertainers, and all kinds of people use to create a landing page where anyone can send some amount of money as a thank you for their services.

It's basically just a way of giving your audience an easy way to say thanks. It can be added to people's pages on their popular social media handles. 

And also creators can avoid the inconveniences of establishing a full-fledged business in order to share and monetize their work.


Here are some popular implementations of this DApp,
- Twitter Tip jar- for allowing followers to be

# Updates 
Added better documentation on code to explain functions and their usages.
Please Note: The only function that's being used is the buyCoffee function, other functions are just for updating the coffee parameters.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
